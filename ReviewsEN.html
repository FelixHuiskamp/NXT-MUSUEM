                This is really too ambitious for my creative brain to understand.
                Too expensive and I don't understand this concept at all.
                Nice for if you are extremely creative I think...
                But to compare with amaze or something like that no...
                I think this was more likely made for space cake or a big smoke.

                Nice museum/gallery.
                The UFO exhibition was very interesting and very relaxing.
                I understand that many people find this annoying,
                but I was there for 3 hours and loved relaxing with the beautiful creations.
